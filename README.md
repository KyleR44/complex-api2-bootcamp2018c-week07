# My Awesome Project
I created a project where you can put in a movie title and get back the picture but also get the cast as well.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

I structured my hmtl first then moved on to my javascript trying to use the driest code possible

## Optimizations
If given more time i would have deffinetly optimized the code more and really make the code as simple as possible

## Lessons Learned:

this my first complex api so i was able to see how to have them interact with one another was really exciting for me

```
I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
I'm not sure if my constructors are setup cleanly...
```
